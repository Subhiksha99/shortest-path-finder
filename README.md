# Shortest-path-finder
Hi everyone,
this project will find the shortest route between two district within Tamilnadhu.It's like google map.
I implemented this project using C++. I am using dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.Datastructure used here is graph. Every district is consider as node and path between two district is consider as edge.
In c++ , i have used oops concept.
This program will give 4 option for the user
1.Adjacency list of the given graph
2.finding shortest route
3.Estimated hour to reach the given city
4.showing nearby district

Then graph details are stored in files. from the files ,the given graph is imported in program.
I have attached the screenshot of the program.
